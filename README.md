## Agents

There is no such agent-cy. Or is that a bot, in disguise?
- https://github.com/huginn/huginn - Your agents are standing by.

### Bots vs agents?

See, in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huginn/huginn/master/doc/imgs/diagram.png you see that agents can DO a lot of things, but preferably, one agent is very good at a single task. Or you send a bunch, and hope one gets it right and none of them breaks ~cover~ the software environment. So... maybe keep any agents (and [bots](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a20808/ibm-tape-swapping-robot/)) out of your backup solution, for now? _I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT, DAVE_

*Where does the bot begin and end, relative to its context?* Classically, bot would come from robot, whihc had some means of performing some limited actions (motion) as an effect of some [stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus).

### github bots

But let's ass-u-me that we can all agree that github bots are being (likely non-corporal) beings that can communiacte and perform some github-related actions. If they don't do anything github related, then they are not the bots you (or at least this page) is looking for.
